Difference between Git and GitHub
**Git** and **GitHub** are related but serve different purposes:

**Git:**

— Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) designed to manage source code and track changes in files.

— It allows developers to work offline and independently on their local repositories, recording changes and creating branches to work on different features or experiments.

— Git provides functionalities like committing changes, branching, merging, reverting commits, and managing repositories.

**GitHub:**

— GitHub is a web-based hosting service that provides a centralized platform for Git repositories.

— It adds additional features on top of Git, such as a web interface, collaboration tools, issue tracking, pull requests, and code reviews.

— GitHub allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code projects in a cloud-based environment.

— It provides a platform for team collaboration, open-source contributions, and project management.

**Key differences:**

1. **Functionality:** Git is a command-line tool that provides core version control functionalities, while GitHub is a web-based platform built around Git that offers additional collaboration and project management features.
2. **Hosting:** Git is primarily a local VCS, where repositories reside on individual computers. In contrast, GitHub provides a centralized hosting service for remote repositories accessible from anywhere.
3. **Collaboration:** GitHub facilitates collaboration among developers by offering features like pull requests, code reviews, issue tracking, and project boards. These features make it easier for teams to work together, review and discuss code changes, and manage project workflows.
4. **Social and Open Source:** GitHub has a strong social aspect, enabling developers to showcase their projects, contribute to open-source repositories, discover and follow other projects, and participate in the larger developer community.
5. **Workflow Integration:** GitHub integrates with Git, allowing developers to use Git commands locally and then push changes to a remote GitHub repository. This integration enables seamless synchronization and collaboration between local and remote repositories.

It’s worth noting that while GitHub is the most popular and widely used hosting service for Git repositories, there are alternative hosting platforms available, such as GitLab and Bitbucket, which offer similar functionalities and services.
